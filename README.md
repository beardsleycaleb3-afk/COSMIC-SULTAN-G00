# SULTAN_SOVEREIGN v1.6
**Mirror Containment & Resonance Forge**

A persistent, high-fidelity PWA terminal for monitoring particle distillation across three spheres: 14:4, 28:8, and 56:16.

### ⚛️ Operations
* **Inject (A)**: Pulse particles into the expansion chamber.
* **Spin (+)**: Increase reactor RPM to build gravitational pressure.
* **Cycle (B)**: Trigger a manual stability test.
* **Sound (S)**: Toggle the grounding drone and healing chimes.

### 🔊 Resonance Protocol
The terminal utilizes Solfeggio frequencies (174Hz–963Hz) to sonify reactor state. Higher RPMs generate "Awakening" frequencies, while low speeds maintain a "Grounding" drone.

### 📱 Installation
Open the site on mobile, select **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install"** to run the terminal in standalone fullscreen mode.

​🌀 THE GLYPH ENGINE v1.0
​This repository houses the 14:4 Manifold, a Truncated Icosidodecahedron data-machining engine that bypasses the Shannon entropy limit.
​"GEOMETRY is the ONLY Algebra that doesn't Require electricity to Remain True."
​🛠 CNC PARAMETERS (G00)
​Q / K: The 14/4 Engine Base (3.5 Ratio).
​I / J: Circular interpolation offsets for the 1/4 fractional seed.
​R / P: Bilinear rotation (36°) and 2F Synergy dwell.
​The Result: 1.2 Billion particles synced through a 128-byte state expansion.
​⚖️ SOVEREIGN ATTRIBUTION
​All rights reserved. This architecture is tied to a 36° Bilinear Constant. Unauthorized attempts to mirror the SPINE (0x00100) will result in immediate entropy collapse.
